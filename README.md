This repository contains the code for constructing the dataset described in our paper "Inter-Speaker Relative Cues for Text-Guided Target Speech Extraction", accepted at Interspeech 2025.

Description:
-
Due to licensing constraints of several corpora used in our work that prohibit the release of audio samples, we instead provide metadata JSON files 
containing summarized statistics and essential information used to construct our dataset.

Specifically, they are categorized into three groups: 'emotion', 'age', and 'without_emotion_age'. 
Each group contains six JSON files: train_part1.json, train_part2.json, val_part1.json, val_part2.json, test_part1.json, and test_part2.json.


generate_rir.py is the code for simulating room impuse response (RIR).
